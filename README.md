# grei-pm
Main NIH-GREI Project Management Repository

## About
This is the main repository for NIH-GREI project management tracking issues. By design, some of the documents, or other resources linked from tracking issues _may not be publicly accessible_.

## About Tracking Issues
Tracking issues are GitHub issues in the [GREI repository]([url](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm)) connecting with deliverables, strategic objectives, and resource monitoring and reporting requirements.

Tracking issues:
- Provide predictable, accessible locations to record and retrieve status on any activity requiring tracking.
- Contain links to documentation, communications channels (e.g., Slack, Zulip), and other related resources.

NIH GREI team members should create a tracking issue in this repository whenever they need tasks tracked, managed, and reported on across multiple sprints.

## Tracking Issue Types
### Task
Smaller units of work defined by GREI (e.g., set of well-defined, related issues) that have specific deliverables. Usually part of epics.
### Deliverables
Products of Tasks, defined by GREI
### Proposal
Development of a proposal for investigating or addressing a problem. When approved, proposals may become projects or go into production. 
### Report
Development and delivery of a specific report (e.g., project status)
### Monitor
Issue for regular monitoring of a system, a resource, or other repeating task
