## Welcome to the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI) project management repository!

To ensure transparency and foster active community engagement, GREI established this platform in Year 3 of the program (2024) to share its objectives and related tasks during the project timeline. See the GREI links section at the bottom of this page for more information about GREI and our vision and mission.

GREI currently includes seven established generalist repositories that work together to establish consistent metadata, develop use cases for data sharing and reuse, and train and educate researchers on FAIR data and the importance of data sharing.

## Navigating the GREI Github
The GREI program is currently organized around 8 objectives, which provide the framework for unique collaborative tasks and repository implementation efforts. The GREI GitHub is thus organized using two primary issue types, GREI Objectives and GREI Tasks.
Each objective issue listed below provides details about our work related to the objective, including links to completed collaborative outputs, notes on progress toward repository implementation tasks, and a history of tasks per objective throughout the program. 


- [GREI Objective 1 - Desirable Repository Characteristics #1](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/1)
- [GREI Objective 2 - Consistent Metadata #7](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/7)
- [GREI Objective 3 - Search & Browse #10](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/10)
- [GREI Objective 4 - Analytics and Reporting #11](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/11)
- [GREI Objective 5 - Use Cases #12](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/12)
- [GREI Objective 6 - Connecting Digital Objects #13](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/13)
- [GREI Objective 7 - QA/QC #14](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/14)
- [GREI Objective 8 - Training & Community Engagement #15](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/15)

From the objective issues, you can follow links to task issues that provide additional details about each task and work that has been done or is planned in support of it.

## Engaging with the GREI Github
As a stakeholder, researcher, or interested community member, we invite you to give feedback and initiate discussions via the [GREI Discussion Board](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/discussions). Please use the [FEEDBACK](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/discussions/new?category=feedback) and [IDEAS](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/discussions/new?category=ideas) discussion categories, each of which contains a template guiding users on how to engage with the GREI objectives and provide ideas for consideration.
