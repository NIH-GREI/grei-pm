# grei-pm
Welcome to the main project management repository. To ensure transparency and foster active community engagement, GREI established this platform in YEAR 3 to share its objectives and related tasks during the project timeline. The community can access detailed information about our goals and ongoing efforts here: https://about.zenodo.org/projects/grei/

The vision of the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI) is to develop collaborative approaches for data management and sharing through the inclusion of generalist repositories in the NIH data ecosystem. GREI also aims to better enable search and discovery of NIH-funded data in generalist repositories. 

GREIâ€™s mission is twofold:

1. The primary mission is to establish a common set of cohesive and consistent capabilities, services, metrics, and social infrastructure across generalist repositories.

2. The secondary mission is to raise general awareness and help researchers adopt FAIR principles to better share and reuse data.

GREI currently includes seven established generalist repositories that work together to establish consistent metadata, develop use cases for data sharing and reuse, train and educate researchers on FAIR data and the importance of sharing:
- [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
- [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash)
- [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)
- [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/)
- [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/)
- Vivli](https://vivli.org/)
- Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

## Engaging with the GREI Github
- Start by navigating the YEAR 3 objectives: [Y3-NIH-GREI: Approved NIH GREI Coopetition Plan Year 3 - Overall Summary](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/16)
  - Within the year 3 Objectives, the [Task Group PM](https://github.com/NIH-GREI/grei-pm/issues/34) issue holds all task groups, tasks and deliverables, and expected outputs, including links to those outputs when available
    - Each ACTIVE task and deliverable contains the GitHub contact information for the group co-leads and members. You may utilize these contacts to direct question and comments on the tasks and deliverables.
- Year 1 and Year 2 goals and deliverables are also available for review

## About
This is the main repository for NIH-GREI project management tracking issues. Each year, GREI establishes goals around its main objectives and designates Task Groups to bring those goals to completion. The following Coopetition Plan Year tracking issues link to all other tracking issues. By design, some of the documents, or other resources linked from tracking issues _may not be publicly accessible_.

## About Tracking Issues
Tracking issues are GitHub issues in the GREI repository connecting with deliverables, strategic objectives, and resource monitoring and reporting requirements.


Tracking issues:
- Provide predictable, accessible locations to record and retrieve status on any activity requiring tracking.
- Contain links to documentation, communications channels (e.g., Slack), and other related resources.

NIH GREI team members should create a tracking issue in this repository whenever they need tasks tracked, managed, and reported on across multiple sprints.

## Tracking Issue Types
### Task
Smaller units of work defined by GREI (e.g., set of well-defined, related issues) that have specific deliverables. Usually part of epics.
### Deliverables
Products of Tasks, defined by GREI
### Proposal
Development of a proposal for investigating or addressing a problem. When approved, proposals may become projects or go into production. 
### Report
Development and delivery of a specific report (e.g., project status)
### Monitor
Issue for regular monitoring of a system, a resource, or other repeating task
